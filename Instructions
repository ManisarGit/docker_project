# What technologies are used in this application?
This application uses python3 and redis to generate a website that count the amount of times
that a visitor has visited it.


Redis details:
 - Redis is installed in ubuntu with apt install redis
 - Redis runs on the default port 6379
 - If redis is not present before booting up the web application, the webapp will crash.

Python details:
 - Python 3.8 is used
 - app.py contains the source code
 - requirements.txt contains the app's dependencies.
 - pip install -r requirements.txt installs the dependencies
 - The REDIS_HOST env variable defines what redis host the app should use
 - The app runs on port 8080.

 All the configuration mentioned above is implemented in the start.sh script.
 You can read it to further understand technical details.


# How to bring up the services?

You can bring up the application by running the `start.sh` script as follows:

```
$ bash start.sh

# Expected output
Ensuring redis ...
Ensuring pip ...
Ensuring python dependencies ...
Starting app on port 8080 ...
Waiting for the server to boot up ...
Server is running on port 8080
```


NOTE: The application MUST run on port 8080 for this URL to work.

# How to test the application?

You can send a http request to localhost:8080 from your workspace

```
$ curl -s localhost:8080|grep -i you
<h1>You've visited this website <span class="white">1 </span> times!</h1>
```

Call it a couple more times, and see the counter increasing!

```
$ curl -s localhost:8080|grep -i you
<h1>You've visited this website <span class="white">2 </span> times!</h1>

$ curl -s localhost:8080|grep -i you
<h1>You've visited this website <span class="white">3 </span> times!</h1>
```

# How to stop the services?
You can bring down the application by running the `stop.sh` script as follows:

```
$ bash stop.sh

# Expected output
All services were successfully stopped.
```

Try calling the application:
```
$ curl localhost:8080
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080: Connection refused
```

# Note

Everytime you stop and start the application, the counter will restart!
